And here is my solution :   
```var uniqueInOrder = function (iterable) {  
  const input = Array.isArray(iterable) ? iterable : iterable.split('');  
  let result = [];  
  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {  
     if(result[result.length - 1] !== input[i]){  
      result.push(input[i])}  
  };return result};
